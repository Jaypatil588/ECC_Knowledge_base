 6. Student ELSJ Resources

In academic courses at SCU that involve community-based
learning, students will engage in critical and reflective community-
based activities as a component of the curriculum of the course. These
community engagement experiences generally take place off campus, yet
are fully integrated with the in-class component of the course.


      Completing the ELSJ Requirement

See the Integrations course listings <https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/
integrations/#d.en.422981> for courses approved for ELSJ. This
requirement can be satisfied in two ways: with one of the approved ELSJ
courses or with an ELSJ 9.

1.    One class, incorporating the key elements, in which all students
receive ELSJ credit upon passing the course (units variable).

2.    One nondepartmental independent study "ELSJ 9” class (one
unit) Enrolled students will participate in a pre-approved Ignatian
Center immersion in advance of the course. Coursework will allow
students to reflect on the immersion experience and explore what it
means to live in solidarity with our local and global community.
Students will strengthen their ability to work sensitively and
respectfully with communities that are socially, economically, and/or
politically marginalized or oppressed. Course assignments include
critical reflections and an academic research paper. Enrollment by
permission only.

Community-based learning placement opportunities are available through
Santa Clara programs such as the Arrupe Engagement Program <https://
www.scu.edu/ic/programs/arrupe-weekly-engagement/> and Ignatian Center
Immersions <https://www.scu.edu/ic/programs/immersions/>.
