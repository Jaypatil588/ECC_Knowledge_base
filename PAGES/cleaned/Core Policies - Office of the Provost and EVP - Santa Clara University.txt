Students complete their core requirements with courses that have been
pre-approved by Faculty Core Committees.

A single course may satisfy only one Core requirement, with the
following exceptions: 

  * Engineering majors may satisfy more than one Explorations
    requirement with a single course when the course has been approved
    for both of those Core requirements.
  * All students may satisfy an Integrations Core requirement with a
    course that also satisfies a Foundation or Explorations Core
    requirement when the course is approved for both of those Core
    requirements.
  * Students who double major across schools/colleges must complete the
    Core requirements for each of their programs.

All students may satisfy Core requirements with courses required for the
major when the courses are approved for both the major and the Core.

Students normally satisfy Core requirements with courses carrying four
or five units, with the following exceptions:

  * Some students satisfy some requirements with more than one course,
    each of which partially completes the requirement. For example,
    students majoring in engineering may satisfy a requirement with more
    than one course. Those courses are identified in CourseAvail as
    “xxxPAR” because they “partially” fulfill a requirement
  * The Arts requirement can be satisfied either by a single course of
    four or five units or with a combination of approved courses
    totaling at least four units.
  * The Pathways requirement is satisfied by combinations of three or
    four courses: three (or a minimum of 12 units) for engineering
    majors and transfer students who enroll with 44 or more units of
    transfer credit, and four (or a minimum of 16 units) for all other
    majors and transfer students who enroll with fewer than 44 units of
    transfer credit.

Students normally satisfy the Core requirements with graded courses
unless a course approved for the Core Curriculum is only offered P/NP.

Independent Study, Directed Reading, Directed Research, Practicum, and
Internship courses do not qualify for Core credit.

Although most students will take Foundations courses in the first year,
the order in which Core courses are completed is flexible, with the
following exceptions:

Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 are
two-quarter, themed, sequenced courses. Students must consult with one
of the University advisors in the Drahmann Center before making any
changes in their enrollment in these courses.

  * Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 are prerequisites for Advanced
    Writing.
  * Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2 and 3 must be taken in sequence.
  * Religion, Theology & Culture 3 courses only count for the Core
    requirement after students have completed 88 quarter units.
  * A course satisfying the Cultures & Ideas 3 requirement is normally
    taken after completing Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2.
  * A course satisfying the Science, Technology & Society requirement is
    normally taken after completing Natural Science and Social Science
    Core requirements.

Many courses offered through the study abroad program are preapproved to
fulfill Core Curriculum requirements. However, only the second-level
Core requirement in Religion, Theology, and Culture (RTC 2) can be
fulfilled with a preapproved study abroad course. The third-level Core
requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture cannot be fulfilled with a
study abroad course.
