    Vocation

*Facilitator: Luis Calero, S.J., Ignatian Center *

What am I good at? What do I love to do? What should I do with my life?
The Vocation Pathway will help you answer these questions. Exploring
these questions from diverse perspectives, you will develop your own
sense of vocation, pursuing a meaningful life, not merely a livelihood.
You will reflect on your life to discover your gifts your talents and
strengths and discern your deepest values to live with greater joy,
integrity, and balance. Considering the worlds most pressing needs, you
will discover your own path of contribution, developing the clarity,
courage, and conviction to make a positive difference in the world.
