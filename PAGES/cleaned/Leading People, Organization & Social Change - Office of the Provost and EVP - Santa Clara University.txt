    Leading People, Organization & Social Change

*Facilitator: Barry Posner, Management*

Courses in this Pathway examine theories of leadership and cultivate the
skills and competencies necessary to lead people and organizations to
achieve social change. Students will be exposed to historical and
current examples of leaders and their impact on the communities they
serve. Students will also explore and research methods leaders use to
inspire, initiate and accomplish change in various formal, social and
community roles and settings. Throughout the experience, students will
be challenged to think and reflect on the type of leader they believe
they should become in order to achieve their goals while addressing the
needs of the greater community.
