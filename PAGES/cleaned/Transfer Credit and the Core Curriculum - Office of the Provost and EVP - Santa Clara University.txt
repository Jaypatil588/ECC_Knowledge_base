 4. Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum

All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara
University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Religion,
Theology & Culture courses; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for
Social Justice; and Pathways. For all other Core requirements, it is
possible for students to earn credit by taking Advanced Placement (AP)
or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, or by completing college-
level courses prior to enrolling at Santa Clara.

Transfer credit earned from courses completed before enrollment at Santa
Clara is governed by two sets of rules: one for students admitted as
first-year students and another for transfer students.

Students admitted as first-year students must satisfy Critical Thinking
& Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, and Religion, Theology &
Culture 1, 2, and 3 with courses completed at Santa Clara University.

In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete
Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2,
before their first quarter at Santa Clara. Information about possible
substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas
courses is available in the Office of the Registrar.

Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units and
incomplete CTW or C&I sequences must take both courses in the Critical
Thinking & Writing 1 & 2 sequence and/or in the Cultures & Ideas 1 & 2
sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable
college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, and
have completed the first course in the sequence, will complete the
sequence with an advanced course (either Cultures & Ideas 3 or Advanced
Writing, depending on the sequence).

Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must
take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in sequential order.
Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college
credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, must complete
two courses from the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence in any order.

Transfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third
quarter at SCU. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences
and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units
must take four courses (minimum of 16 units) toward the Pathways
requirement. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and
Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must
take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways
requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must
take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways requirement.

According to University policy, up to 10 transfer units may be accepted
after a student has matriculated to SCU. These units can be applied to
Core requirements if they meet the guidelines listed above. Please see
the Post-Matriculation Transfer Credit Process <https://www.scu.edu/
media/institutional-pages/admission/pdfs/Process-for-Earning-Post-
Matric-Transfer-Credit_.pdf>.

Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters
7 and 8 of the SCU bulletin, as well as the chapter(s) relevant to their
school or college.
