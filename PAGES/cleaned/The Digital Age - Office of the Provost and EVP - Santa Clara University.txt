 7. The Digital Age


    The Digital Age

*Facilitator: Yi Fang, Computer Engineering*

The Digital Age, also called the Information Age, refers to a new
emphasis on electronic manipulation of information influencing the
global economy in ways the production and exchange of physical goods
influenced economies in the past, in the industrial age. Explosive
growth of the Internet over the past decade allows information, goods,
and services to be shared between people of all economic levels from
around the globe. This instant accessibility to news, entertainment, and
information has changed the way we communicate, shop, and learn.
Because society is changed by technology, those who steer the
development and course of technology should be knowledgeable about and
sensitive to the effects of their work on others. Courses in this
Pathway will offer opportunities for learning about digital information
technology and the way it pervades our lives. A main Pathway goal will
be to deepen knowledge and understanding of the complex interplay
between social, moral, political and cultural values and our digital
society through integrative, cross-disciplinary learning.
