    Children, Family and Society

*Facilitator: Brett Solomon, Child Studies *

Courses in this Pathway will offer students the opportunity to learn
about children from several disciplinary perspectives, to learn about
the societal and cultural structures that provide the context for
development such as the family and school, and to gain experience
working with children in the community. Students may discover that the
courses lead them on a pathway to vocation: as they become both more
informed and more passionate about children, they will be attracted to
professional fields that address the needs of children and families,
such as teaching, counseling, social work, family law, public health,
and pre-med. In sum, students who love children and want to work with
them will have the opportunity for more in depth learning about the
knowledge and personal commitment that are required for such a vocation.
