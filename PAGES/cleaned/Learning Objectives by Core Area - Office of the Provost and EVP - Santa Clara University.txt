Second Language

<#accordion-panel-424404>


      Second Language

Communication in a second language is an essential skill in the
globalizing world. Training in additional languages provides students
experience of the different perspectives that the use of another
language affords. Jesuit education has always promoted the study of
second languages to facilitate intercultural understanding.

Mathematics

<#accordion-panel-424405>


      Mathematics

Mathematics is a basic building block of contemporary society and, over
the centuries, has had a profound impact on the natural sciences,
technology and the social sciences. This requirement develops
competencies in mathematics, both as a pure discipline and as an
important tool in problem solving.Mathematics develops both analytical
and logical reasoning, as well as the capacity to think abstractly about
a wide range of theoretical and practical problems.


        Learning Objectives for Mathematics

*1.1*    Demonstrate their problem solving skills, including their
ability to interpret problem situations, choose among several
potentially appropriate mathematical methods of solution, persist in the
face of difficulty, and present full and cogent solutions that include
appropriate justification for their reasoning.

*1.2*    Demonstrate their ability to approach mathematical ideas or
problems from multiple perspectives (e.g., by using the internal
connections between geometry, algebra, and numerical computation;
applying the connections between theory and applications; or
distinguishing between a formal proof and less formal arguments and
understanding the different roles these play in mathematics).

*1.3*    Demonstrate an understanding of mathematical content (including
the limits to its application) that goes beyond mere fluency in using
mathematical symbols, language and formulas.

Religion, Theology and Culture 1

<#accordion-panel-424406>


      Religion, Theology and Culture 1

Religion, Theology & Culture 1 is the first in a third part series of
courses designed to promote a critical engagement between faith and
cultures and exemplify a commitment to academic excellence and freedom.
The first course aims to enhance critical reflection on religious belief
and practice.It introduces students to the basic approaches by which
scholars seek to understand what religion reveals about human beings—
their societies, traditions, convictions, and aspirations.


        Learning Objectives for Religion, Theology, and Culture 1

*1.1  *   Describe and compare the central religious ideas and practices
from at least two locally or globally distinct cultures or communities.
(Knowledge of Global Cultures; Complexity of content as well as method;
Ambiguity)

*1.2  *   Use critical approaches to reflect on their own beliefs and
the religious dimensions of human existence. (Critical Thinking;
Complexity of Method; Reflection)

Ethics

<#accordion-panel-424408>


      Ethics

The Jesuit character of the university promotes sustained attention to
moral philosophy as applied to the problems of contemporary life. A
course in this area helps students to understand how major ethical
theories construe ideals such as justice, happiness, virtue, dignity,
rights, and equality.It helps students apply these theories to questions
of how individuals and institutions should act in the world.


        Learning Objectives for Ethics

*1.1*     Reason ethically by drawing on major ethical theories and
traditions (e.g., virtue ethics, feminist ethics, deontological or
consequentialist theories) as a means to normatively assess individual,
professional, and institutional decisions, issues, or other matters of
ethical significance. (Arts & Humanities, Critical Thinking, Ethical
Reasoning)
*1.2*     Analyze, critically evaluate, and apply major ethical theories
and traditions to significant personal, professional, and institutional
decisions, issues, or other matters of ethical significance. Students
should be able to articulate some central ethical concepts, e.g.,
justice, happiness, the good, virtue, dignity, moral rights, and
equality (Arts & Humanities, Critical Thinking, Ethical Reasoning)
*1.3*     Demonstrate appreciation of nuance and ambiguity, as well as
clarity and precision, in their thinking and writing about ethical
problems, concepts, and ideals. (Critical Thinking, Complexity)
*1.4*     Reflect on their own ethical decisions and actions, on their
roles as morally responsible members of the human community, and on what
it means to be a good person. (Critical Thinking, Complexity)

 

Civic Engagement

<#accordion-panel-424409>


      Civic Engagement

The health of any democratic community depends largely on the ability of
its members to participate in and contribute actively to community
service, philanthropy, and the political system.Fostering civic
participation is a vital part of all universities' missions and a
central goal of Jesuit education. Courses in this area deepen students'
understanding of the rights and responsibilities of citizens in relation
to selected institutions and issues, but also cultivate civic skills and
dispositions needed for active citizenship.


        Learning Objectives for Civic Engagement

*1.1*     Critically evaluate, and express reasoned opinions about, the
role of public organizations (governmental, non governmental,
multilateral, or international) in civic life through both oral and
written work. (Civic Life, Communication)

*1.2*     Analyze and evaluate civic issues by engaging in active and
collaborative learning with peers and others through one or more of the
following: a) working cooperatively with other students in class; b)
actual observation and participation in the contemporary ramifications
of various types of civic life or civic discourse; or c) working with
civic organizations beyond the walls of the University. (Civic Life,
Collaboration, and Civic Engagement)

Diversity: U.S. Perspectives

<#accordion-panel-424410>


      Diversity: U.S. Perspectives

Diversity courses directly address and help fulfill the university's
mission of working toward a more humane and just world. The courses
deepen students' knowledge of diverse human experiences, identities, and
cultures.In this area, students will analyze the relations between
peoples or social categories that are associated with differences in
power and privilege, such as race, gender, ethnicity, nationality,
citizenship, religion, class, sexual orientation, physical ability, and
so on.


        Learning Goals for Diversity: U.S. Perspectives

*Diversity:* Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within
local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power
and privilege.

*Perspective:* Seeking out the experience of different cultures and
people, striving to view the world through their eyes.

*Social Justice:* Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes
of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for
addressing them.

gender, ethnicity, nationality, age, language, citizenship, religion,
class, sexual orientation, or physical ability. (Diversity, Social Justice)

Arts

<#accordion-panel-424411>


      Arts

The education of the whole person requires that students encounter and
explore artistic ways of knowing humanity and the world. Creating and
interpreting aesthetic forms symbolic of deep human feeling encourages
students to consider how knowledge and understanding grown in ways other
than discursive reasoning. From the beginning of the Jesuit educational
experience, study of the arts has been employed to cultivate humanity,
encourage growth in virtue, and school the body in the ways of verbal
and physical eloquence.


        Learning Objectives for Arts

*1.1  * Learn and apply basic artistic techniques and aesthetic
principles to create works of art (Arts and Humanities, Communication)

*1.2*   Demonstrate an understanding of how artistic creation enables
the expression of human ideals, challenges, and desires. (Arts and
Humanities, Complexity, Communication).

*1.3*   Reflect on and analyze works of art and the creative process,
individually and collaboratively (Arts and Humanities, Complexity,
Collaboration, Communication). 

 

Natural Science

<#accordion-panel-424412>


      Natural Science

Students need a deeper understanding of the natural sciences in order to
make informed choices as citizens, as professionals, and as individuals.
Courses in this area familiarize students with some of the most
important scientific ideas, with the fundamental assumptions and ways of
thinking in the sciences, and how scientists acquire new knowledge.
Students should understand the power, beauty, and limits of knowledge
produced by scientific methods of inquiry.


        Learning Objectives for Natural Science

*1.1*     Demonstrate a basic understanding of the theory and concepts
central to the study of a particular topic or discipline in the natural
sciences. (Scientific Inquiry, Complexity, Critical Thinking)

formulating testable hypotheses, identifying variables, or collecting
experimental or observational data that explain phenomena in the natural
world. (Scientific Inquiry, Complexity, Critical Thinking)

*1.3*     Interpret scientific data, qualitatively and quantitatively,
in order to derive conclusions appropriate to the scope and quality of
the data, attentive to concepts of probability, causation, and
correlation. (Scientific Inquiry, Complexity, Critical Thinking,
Mathematical & Quantitative Reasoning)

*1.4*     Recognize limitations of evidence produced by experimental and
observational methods. (Scientific Inquiry, Complexity, Critical
Thinking, Mathematical & Quantitative Reasoning)

Social Science

<#accordion-panel-424413>


      Social Science

Everyday indicators of human well-being—from the unemployment rate to
the crime rate—are not self-evident, but the product of social
scientific choices about how to think about and measure social life.To
make well-informed decisions in their civic and professional lives,
students will rely heavily on social scientific theory and data about
human behavior and societies. Students will need to understand how the
social sciences produce knowledge in distinct ways and gain experience
in assessing theory and evidence in at least one branch of the social
sciences.


        Learning Objectives for Social Science

*1.1*     Explain theories, concepts, and methods central to the study
of a particular topic or discipline in the social sciences.

*1.2*     Apply scientific reasoning and methods of inquiry to examine
phenomena in the social world.
