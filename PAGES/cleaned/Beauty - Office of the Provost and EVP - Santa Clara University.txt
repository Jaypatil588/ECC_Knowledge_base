    Beauty

*Facilitator: Andrea Pappas, Art and Art History*

We value love, money, fun, faith, work, thought, inspiration, community,
and friendship. Why? Is it enough to say that these things help us to
survive in the world, or do we value these things for reasons that are
much more difficult to explain? In this Pathway, we explore a more
complex and controversial motivation for human energy, an23 interest in
beauty. It is an interest we do not always embrace, often preferring the
less risky concepts of cute or cool. But while Thomas Kinkade and Kenny
G might fit right in, Beethoven sonatas and Michelangelo sculptures are
difficult to characterize with such perfunctory terms. We encourage
students setting off on this Pathway to consider whether there is a
realm of the beautiful and, if there is, identify some of its
characteristics and manifestations.
