 7. Democracy


    Democracy

*Facilitator: Chad Raphael, Communication*

This Pathway will focus on the history, theory, and practice of
democracy. As both a political philosophy and a way of allocating power,
democracy may be studied in many contexts:
Within political systems, as rule by the people.
Within social systems, influencing and influenced by other institutions,
such as the economy, education, philanthropy, science and technology,
social services, the arts, religion, the media, and even the family.
In non-governmental institutions, shaping decision-making and rights of
stakeholders.
The unifying goal of this Pathway is to help each student draw
conclusions about the contributions to and practice of democracy in
contemporary institutions relevant to the students major and/or vocation.
