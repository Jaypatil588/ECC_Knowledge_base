    Values in Science & Technology

*Facilitator: Di Di, Assistant Professor, Sociology *

Our contemporary world is shaped by science and technology to such a
profound degree that our students cannot be effective leaders and
citizens without the capacity to critically engage the scientific and
technological dimensions of society. This pathway invites students to
understand the social values and social context of science & technology
as social forces. It will provide opportunities for students from all
majors to critically examine the practice of science, the social
dimensions of technology, the role that these play in society, and the
influences of social values on these. This pathway is open to all
students interested in this topic, and one need not be a science or
engineering major to choose it. Natural science and engineering majors
will find it highly accessible because it includes required lower and
upper division courses from these majors. Students in all majors are
encouraged to take classes in the social sciences and humanities to
integrate consideration of social values in their pathway. This pathway
has roughly one hundred classes in it, but students should plan their
upper division courses very carefully, since many of these are
restricted to specific majors.
