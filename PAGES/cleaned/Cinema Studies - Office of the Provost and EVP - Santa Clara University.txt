    Cinema Studies 

*Facilitator: Michael Whalen, Communication*

Courses in this Pathway will help students engage in the critical study
of film and television history, theory, aesthetics, and production.
Students will engage in the interdisciplinary study of national cinemas,
international film movements, major and minor filmmakers in various
traditions, film and media theory, the economic, legal, and political
forces governing the film and television industries, and the
relationship between film, television, the arts and culture. Students in
this pathway may be asked to analyze and reflect on films or television
shows already created or create new films or videos as part of this
inquiry. Students may also be asked to compare film and television to
other art forms such as novels or plays.
A main goal of the Cinema Studies Pathway is to deepen the knowledge and
understanding of how cinema shapes, and is shaped, by the culture it
exists in and emerge not only knowledgeable about cinema and television,
but also enriched by contact with history, literature, foreign cultures,
philosophy, and theology.
