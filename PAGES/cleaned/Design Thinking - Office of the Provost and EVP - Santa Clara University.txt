    Design Thinking

*Facilitator: Christopher Kitts, Mechanical Engineering*

Design thinking provides a holistic approach to the development of new
products and processes, emphasizing the creative, interdisciplinary
synthesis of new systems that can lead to solutions for real problems.
Important aspects of design thinking include the innovative application
of technology as well as the need to harness such innovation in a
sustainable enterprise. Design thinking may be applied to a vast range
of problems, from designing a new consumer product, to adapting a device
for low-cost and local production in the developing world, to solving
global issues such as climate change and health care. This pathway is
open to all students and invites them to discover the many elements of
design thinking. The topic may be explored from a wide range of
perspectives, such as those characteristic of the arts, humanities,
sciences, social sciences, business, and engineering.
