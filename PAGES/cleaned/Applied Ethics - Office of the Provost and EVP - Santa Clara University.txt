    Applied Ethics

*Facilitator: Karen Peterson-Iyer, Religious Studies*

This pathway invites students to explore the application of critical
ethical thinking to real world problems, thereby deepening their
understanding of their vocational and educational choices. Courses in
this pathway address ethical issues in areas such as communication,
economics and business, healthcare, politics, gender, sustainability,
diplomacy and war. All pathway courses include intentional and sustained
discussion of the practical ethical dimensions of course content.
Courses raise a wide range of applied ethics problems in diverse fields
and professional arenas. Ethics is by nature interdisciplinary, drawing
on diverse theories, methodologies, and traditions in various
disciplines, including biology, engineering, gender studies, literature,
organizational theory, philosophy, and religious studies. Pathway
courses support students critical consideration of specific real life
dilemmas and their exploration of methodologies and reasoned solutions
to controversial practical moral issues. (Please note most courses in
this Pathway do not satisfy the Core Ethics requirement.)
