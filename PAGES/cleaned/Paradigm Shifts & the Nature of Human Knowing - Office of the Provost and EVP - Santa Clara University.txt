    Paradigm Shifts & the Nature of Human Knowing

*Facilitator: TBD*

At some time or another, many perhaps all disciplines have experienced a
sea change in thought, when one or more scholars have pushed beyond the
limits of the fields traditional approaches, assumptions, and
understandings. Such dramatic, often rapid, changes that result in a
shift away from previously accepted ways of thinking about a discipline
can provide the opportunity for you to explore how people learn and how
we think. In addition, understanding the sometimes wildly different ways
knowledge is constructed and evidence interpreted in different
disciplines can help you reflect more insightfully on your own
education. This pathway includes courses that address ways of thinking
within a discipline that are departures from the accepted norms and
courses that include the usual ways of knowing and understanding in a
discipline.

Exploring the pathway:
Look for the ways in which the topics in your Paradigm Shifts & the
Nature of Human Knowing pathway courses are connected to the themes of
the pathway. You might find it helpful to explore questions such as these:

What are the ways that knowledge, approaches, and assumptions are
identified?

How can you apply this understanding to gaining insight into how you
yourself come to know and understand? Can you tie this insight to an
understanding of your past and future educational choices? Can you tie
this insight to an understanding of your vocational choices?

Identify specific examples of a paradigm shift in your pathway courses.
In what ways did a departure from the accepted norms in a discipline
come about? What similarities and differences can you find between the
ways departures from previously accepted ways of thinking occur in
different disciplines?

Can you identify the emergence of an issue associated with the themes of
this pathway in more than one of your pathway courses, that is, can you
find a thread that is common to a number of these disciplines

Can you identify either overlapping or opposing approaches to the way we
know and understand, based on your pathway courses?

Can you identify connections between the themes of this pathway and
topics you have studied in your major?
You may discover that some of your instructors in courses in the
Paradigm Shifts & the Nature of Human Knowing pathway don't directly
mention a paradigm shift or directly address the nature of knowing.
That's okay it's up to you to find the connections and common threads in
these courses. By reflecting on and synthesizing that understanding
across a number of courses for yourself, rather than having your
instructors make the connections for you, you will learn more deeply in
a way that can complement other aspects of your Santa Clara education.
