    Gender, Globalization, & Empire

*Facilitators: Naomi Andrews, History Department; Sharmila Lodhia,
Gender and Sexuality Studies Department*

The Gender, Globalization and Empire Pathway provides students with an
opportunity to examine the production of raced and gendered subjects
through a series of interdisciplinary courses linking ideas about gender
to imperial pasts, postcolonial theories, social and political
constructions of citizenship, diverse religious movements and the
intricacies of globalization. Courses associated with the Gender,
Globalization and Empire Pathway highlight the need to historicize and
contextualize individuals experiences within relevant categories of
race, sex, class, culture and nation. Issues students will likely
encounter in these courses include, but are not limited to: orientalism,
modernity, hegemony, nationalism, militarism, fundamentalism and the
gendered division of labor.
