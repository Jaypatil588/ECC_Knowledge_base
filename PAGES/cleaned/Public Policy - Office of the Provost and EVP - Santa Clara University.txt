    Public Policy

*Facilitators: Kenneth Faulve-Montojo and Elsa Chen, Political Science*

A policy is a plan of action intended to achieve objectives. Public
policy involves the laws that apply to citizens and residents and also
to the organization of government. The laws include taxation, subsidies,
and regulations. Policy involves ethics that provide justification of
the objectives (such as equity), a political philosophy that applies to
the structure of government, and implied theories of economics,
sociology, and political science as applied to implementation. For
example, a policy of the control of the money supply implies a belief in
a theory of how the quantity of money and its control by the monetary
authority affects an economy.
