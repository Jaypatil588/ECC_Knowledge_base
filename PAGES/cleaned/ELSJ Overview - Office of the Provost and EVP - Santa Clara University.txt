    “Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty
    reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel
    it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage
    in it constructively."

    — “The Service of Faith and the Promotion of Justice in American,
    Jesuit Higher Education,” address at Santa Clara University, Santa
    Clara, California, October 6, 2000.

Experiential Learning for Social Justice (ELSJ) is one of the
Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements that makes a Santa Clara
education truly unique. A University-wide requirement such as ELSJ
currently exists within only a small number of universities across the
U.S. and has a distinctly Jesuit flavor. ELSJ courses at SCU
involve community-based learning (CBL), through which students will
engage in critical and reflective community-based activities as
a component of the curriculum of the course. These community engagement
experiences generally take place off campus, yet are fully integrated
with the in-class academic components of the course.

SCU is committed to providing ELSJ opportunities to students that will
allow them to connect more deeply to a rigorous academic curriculum;
explore issues of power, privilege, and oppression; bring knowledge from
their discipline into dialogue with knowledge from the community; and
experience the realities of the world for the purpose of fashioning a
more humane and just society. 

Equally important are the benefits CBL contributes to the community. By
bringing the skills of faculty and students to support the work of
community partners, CBL helps the University to build productive
and sustainable community relationships.
