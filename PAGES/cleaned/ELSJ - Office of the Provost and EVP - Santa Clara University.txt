The Experiential Learning for Social Justice (ELSJ) component of Santa
Clara’s Core curriculum cultivates social justice, civic life,
perspective, and civic engagement.

To echo the words of Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, S.J.: ELSJ provides
Santa Clara students with opportunities for experiencing the gritty
reality of the world, thinking critically about the world, responding to
its suffering, and engaging it constructively. ELSJ’s Rubrics, Reports,
and Guidelines <https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/faculty-resources/
