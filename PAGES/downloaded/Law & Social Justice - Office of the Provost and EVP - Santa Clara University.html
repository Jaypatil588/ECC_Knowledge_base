    Law & Social Justice

*Facilitators: Matthew Harrigan, Political Science, and Deborah Moss-
West, Law*

The Law and Social Justice Pathway offers students a cross-disciplinary
opportunity to learn about and focus on issues related to social justice
particularly from a legal perspective. Students who are considering
going to law school or pursuing a career in legal services will be able
to study the principles behind the justice system and have practical
experiences that expose them to social justice issues in the community.
This Pathway is also beneficial to students considering a career in
government, social services, or public service as students will learn
about community needs and deepen their understanding of how
underrepresented, marginalized, and subordinated client populations and
causes can be served through social justice law.
