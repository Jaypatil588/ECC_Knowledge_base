    Feeding the World

*Facilitators: Chris Norris, Executive Director, Sustainable Business
Institute; Carol Kelly, Program Director, Sustainable Business Institute*

The Feeding the World pathway focuses on the complex interrelationships
among food production, food consumption, hunger, poverty, and the
environment. Students in the pathway will explore how the production,
consumption, and distribution of food resources are impacted by a
variety of factors, including the availability of resources, income
levels, and environmental degradation. The production of food in fragile
environments and the sustainability of subsistence food systems will be
explored, including the role of agricultural development in reducing
hunger and poverty throughout the world.
