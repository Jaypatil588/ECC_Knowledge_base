    American Studies


          Facilitator: James Bennett, Religious Studies 

American Studies is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the
United States, past and present. Students approach the study of American
cultures through such diverse fields as history, literature, religious
studies, art, economics, and environmental studies, and might focus on
such topics as popular culture and material culture, ethnic studies and
gender studies, empire and globalization. American Studies students
analyze America's relations with the rest of the world, the construction
and deconstruction of American identities, and changing and competing
definitions of America (including critiques of the very name "American
Studies").

We encourage students to intentionally craft a four-course cluster
around a theme or topic of special interest to them. Such intentional
focus will also make it easier for students to complete the reflection
paper. Below are suggested possible ways of crafting such a cluster or
focus, although students should feel free to develop and define their
own individualized cluster topic:

  * American Regions (i.e., The West and California, America and the
    Caribbean, Interregionalism, America and the Atlantic)
  * Politics and Activism
  * Transnationalism and Globalization
  * Colonialism/Postcolonialism
  * Historical Periods (i.e., The Colonial Period, The 19th Century,
    Modernism, Postmodernism)
  * Gender and Sexuality
  * Race and Ethnicity
