    Gender, Sexuality, & the Body

*Facilitator: Linda Garber, Women's and Gender Studies Department*

This Pathway allows students to explore cultural representations and
social constructions of the gendered human body and sexuality. Because
gender and sexuality are constructed through other categories such as
ethnicity, age, and physically ability, courses will include a
significant diversity component. And because the categories of gender
and sexuality have occasioned both privilege and oppression, social
justice will be emphasized as a theme across the Pathway.
