Community Engagement Agreements: Faculty Guidelines for Memoranda of
Understanding (MOUs) with Community Partners


          What is a MOU?

A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is a pro forma written agreement to
be used to establish the formal partnership between your SCU entity and
your community partner organization.


          What is the Community Engagement Data Form?

We have designed a Community Engagement Data Form to help you provide
the right information for our records of SCU community engagement.
You’ll need to fill out and submit this form when you submit the
completed MOU.


          How do I generate a MOU?

We have designed a MOU template to make the MOU completion process as
simple as possible for you. You just need to download the document and
fill in the missing pieces with your community partner organization.


          Where do I find the MOU documents?

The Community Engagement Data Form is also located on the ELSJ website,
on the Faculty ELSJ Resources page <https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/
elsj/faculty-elsj-resources/>. The MOU template is located on the ELSJ
website, on the Faculty ELSJ Resources page.


          When must the MOU be signed?

For new partnerships, MOUs must be signed before students begin to
engage with the partner. For existing and ongoing partnerships that have
already been established, we ask that you complete the MOUs before the
students 01.2017 begin to engage within the current academic year. If
the students have already begun, we ask that you complete the MOUs by
the end of the quarter in which the students started to engage.


          How frequently must MOUs be renewed?

This is for you to determine with your community partner organization.
The typical minimum length of time that a MOU may stand is 1 year. The
maximum length of time that an MOU may stand is 3 years.
