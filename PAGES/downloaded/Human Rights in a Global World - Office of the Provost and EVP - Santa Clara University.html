    Human Rights in a Global World

*Facilitator: Jimia Boutouba, Modern Languages*

The variety of associated courses in this Pathway reflects the
importance of theories of universal human rights and their applications
to a multitude of issues involving oppressed and disadvantaged human
groups around the globe. Most current debates focus on historical or
contemporary cases of discrimination based on racial identity, gender,
caste, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and age, which have
produced deep social and economic inequalities, often given rise to
violence, and occasionally led to ethnic cleansing and mass murder. At
the same time, critics of the United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights of 1948 also debate whether its definition of human rights
exceeds what individuals can fairly demand from society and the state.
Enforcing laws based on a concept of human rights often produces
controversy.

Laws protecting the rights of minorities, immigrants, and/or refugees
can infringe on what rival social groups consider to be their human
rights. The definition of who is human, and thus deserving of these
rights, also raises complex social, ethical and legal issues. If the
unborn child, fertilized egg or even unfertilized egg is legally defined
as a rights-bearing human being, how might that legal definition impinge
on the rights of women and the general public? Can we even take for
granted the universal applicability to other cultural traditions of
human rights that were invented in the Enlightenment and expanded in
Western thought and practice since then? Must we recognize a cultural
bias in our own claims for human rights when we encounter cultures with
a different social logic in keeping with their own religious and
philosophical understandings? These are only some of the probing
questions that any student who embarks on a Pathway on human rights in a
global world will encounter.
