    Race, Place & Social Inequalities

*Facilitator: James Lai, Political Science and Ethnic Studies*

Courses in this Pathway will examine the intersections of race/
ethnicity, place, and social inequalities within either a transnational
comparative context including the United States or exclusively within
the United States. Particularly important to this Pathway will be racial
groups such as African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native
Americans, and Multi-racial/ethnic individuals. In addition, Whites will
be examined in regard to Whiteness and White privilege in relation to
the above racial minority groups. The term is open to various
definitions such as the study of racial and ethnic communities in a
particular geographic location (city, state, developed and developing
countries, etc.), within dynamic and transient locations (place as
national borders, transnational dynamics, etc.), and within sites of
meaning and social valuation (place as social construct, metaphor,
imagined community, etc.).
Students will be encouraged to explore ideas about race in relation to
particular places and understand ways social inequalities influence

Political mobilization and public opinion
Multi-racial coalitions
Public policies (education, health care, community redevelopment, etc.)
Racial, ethnic, and religious identities
Social movements
Community and organization formations
Race relations
Artistic (literary, visual, and musical) expressions
