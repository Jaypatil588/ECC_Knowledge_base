    Justice & the Arts

*Facilitator: Kristin Kusanovich, Theatre and Dance; Co-Director,
Justice and the Arts Initiative*

Courses in this Pathway will help students develop an understanding of
historical and/or contemporary works of art (music, theatre, dance and
visual art) and literature as responsive, complex, critical or
instigative in relation to issues of justice. Students in this pathway
may be asked to analyze and reflect on artifacts already created, to
experience live performance, or to create work themselves as a part of
this inquiry.
Courses in this pathway expose students to a wide array of artistic
processes and products that take as their theme issues of justice.
Encountering these practices expands our notion of how art is a critical
response to our world. It is through the incarnational arts, the visual,
dramatic/literary, music, theatre and dance arts, that we are presented
with all of the complexity, richness and difficulty of lived experience.
Learning that occurs in and through these disciplines is never merely
abstract, but engages the entire brain, all of the learning modalities
and all of the learning styles. Art and art-making have a way of moving
us to compassion and empathy, of expanding perception, of challenging
the intellect, and of creating community. This pathway helps create a
well-educated solidarity and gives students the tools to shape a better
society and a more creative life.
