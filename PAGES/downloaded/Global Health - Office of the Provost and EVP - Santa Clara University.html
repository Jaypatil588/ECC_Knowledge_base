    Global Health

*Facilitator: Sonja Mackenzie, Public Health*

This Pathway will explore human health and the biological,
environmental, psychological, and social factors that impact it, with
particular attention to global issues, such as infectious disease,
chronic disease, healthcare, mental health, pollution and environmental
degradation, agriculture and nutrition, and poverty and social
inequalities that affect human well-being. All courses included in this
Pathway will include discussion of the social context of health issues,
and issues germane to resource-poor regions of the world.

Why have we chosen this focus? Because good health is fundamental to
human well-being, a basic understanding of the human body and what we
can do to maintain its proper functioning is a perfectly reasonable part
of a holistic liberal education. But in the complex world we live in,
the study of human health encompasses far more than simply the normal
functioning of our bodies. Indeed, most of humanity enjoys nothing like
the excellent health that citizens of wealthy nations often take for
granted.

Courses addressing the broad topic of global health necessarily include
issues of social justice. Many global public health problems are
inextricably linked to poverty and marginalization, which aren't unique
to the developing world. Indeed, people at the bottom of the
socioeconomic ladder in the U.S. have the highest rates of AIDS and
tuberculosis, cancer, obesity, asthma, and psychological stress, and the
least access to quality medical care. How a wealthy country like the
U.S. deals with such gross inequality raises fundamental questions of
fairness and justice. These are issues Santa Clara students should be
grappling with during the course of their education!
