    Sustainability

*Facilitator: Leslie Gray, Environmental Studies and Sciences*

Sustainability is most often defined as meeting our present needs
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
needs. The recognition that sustainability is an imperative that must be
met stems from the fact that humans are using the earths resources and
degrading its ecosystems in ways that compromise the health and well-
being of future generations and the planet. The sustainability Pathway
will allow students to learn about sustainability from multiple
disciplinary perspectives and in interdisciplinary ways. This will help
our students integrate the interconnected ideals of viable ecological
integrity, viable economies, and equity and justice.
Some critical sustainability themes that will be embedded in the
curriculum of sustainability Pathway classes are:

Human Connections to the Physical and Natural World
How Natural Systems Function
Ethics and Values
Technological and Economic Relationships to Encourage Sustainability
Motivating Environmentally Sustainable Behavior
Critical Engagement with Sustainability Issues
