      Overview

Santa Clara University’s Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three
traditions of higher education. The interrelationship of these three
traditions encourages informed and ethical decisions characteristic
of citizens and leaders who are motivated by competence, conscience, and
compassion.

Catholic Values

As a Catholic university, Santa Clara is rooted in pursuing an
understanding of God through the free exercise of reason.


Jesuit Values

As a Jesuit university, Santa Clara provides a humanistic education that
promotes an ethical engagement with the world.


University Values

As a comprehensive North American university committed to liberal
education, Santa Clara fosters academic excellence and responsible,
creative citizenship.


      The Structure of the Undergraduate Core Curriculum

The Santa Clara University Core Curriculum consists of three phases of
academic work:

  * *Foundations* and *Explorations *are designed to deepen knowledge,
    habits of mind and heart, and experiences engaging with the world
    that students bring with them to their undergraduate studies. Many
    course requirements in these phases overlap with requirements for
    majors. Other requirements introduce students to new areas of study.
  * *Integrations *is designed to help students reflect more deeply on
    connections among courses in the Core and between the Core and their
    major.


      Core Curriculum Learning Goals

The Core Curriculum affirms the following central learning goals—
Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World—which
often overlap and reinforce one another.


          Knowledge

Informed engagement in society requires that you comprehend what has
shaped the world you have inherited; the evolving ways of understanding
it; and how you might transform it for the better. To that end, the Core
deepens your knowledge of the most profound ideas and ways of knowing
that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences.


          Habits of Mind and Heart

Contributions to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world
require that you develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting
that foster passionate, purposeful learning for the rest of your lives.
By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human
experience, the Core enables you to think more deeply, imagine more
freely, and communicate more clearly.


          Engagement with the World

Meaningful engagement includes opportunities to explore and refine self-
knowledge, in relation to others. The Core enhances your understanding
of the integrity of your own life and the dignity inherent in the lives
of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized.
